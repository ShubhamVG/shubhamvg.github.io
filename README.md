# LaV's Digital Home
I lost a bet and had to make a very narcissistic website about me and this 
is eggsactly that. A person/portfolio website which is meant to be _all about 
me_, live at [lavisse.xyz](https://lavisse.xyz).

## Made with Jaspr
Check out [jaspr](https://jaspr.site). Web framework written in Dart by 
[Kilian Schultek](https://github.com/schultek).

If you wanna run this locally, then you will need [dart](https://dart.dev)
and [jaspr](https://jaspr.site). Check out the respective websites and docs 
for their installation guides.

The `docs/` folder has the built website which is actually live. The other 
stuff is the source code.
