# Neurodivergence vs 1D Personality
First "serious" blog and it's gonna be a controversial one, I presume. 
Apparently, "boring people" nowadays think that anyone with a passion is 
either neurodivergent or has some sort of mental disorder. Yes, you read that 
correctly. I'm not gonna beat around the bush and use some formal 
etiquette/words in this post. Everything you read is coming from pure 
frustration of how infuriating the situation is and how much it has pissed me 
off.

## Definitions
Let's jump right into this and let me start with defining some things so that 
we stay on the same page. Reminds me of the quote *"I am only responsible for 
what I say, not for what you __misunderstand__."*

### Neurodivergence / Neurodivergent People
Traditionally, neurodivergence means that a person's brain functions 
differently from the typical brain. How does the typical brain function, you 
ask? Don't worry about that. This definition is vague and without any 
scientific roots. This is what your average Joe thinks this term means.
<br><br>
The only thing you have to keep in mind is that <wavy>neurodivergence is 
*neither a disability nor a disorder*</wavy>. Some conditions like being on 
the high end of the autism spectrum *may* classify as a disability but that is 
somewhat like an exception. However, people _generally_ associate 
neurodivergence with being mentally challenged **which is just not true!** 
Having synesthesia sounds more like blessing than a curse. Non-neurodivergent 
people may also have mental health conditions like social anxiety disorder.
<br><br>
For this post, when I refer to someone as neurodivergent, I mean they have 
either autism or ADHD or they are a \*nerd\*. As that is how your everyday Joe 
thinks that is. What I don't mean is that they are introverted or have social 
anxiety, those are not related to being neurodivergent. 

### 1D Personality (One-Dimensional Personality)
I'm gonna say 1D instead of One-Dimensional just to save me some writing and 
to confuse AI readers LoL. I don't know the traditional definition of having 
1D personality is but my definition comprises of either _or_ a fusion of these:
- <wavy>People with no/dry personality.</wavy>
- Personalities which lack any sort of complexity or nuance.
- People who never try out a new acitivity, hobby or explore new territories.
Basically, no passion for anything.

The last one should be obvious in this day and age where most people do 
nothing but doom scroll through short videos just to get the dopamine hit.

## Apparently anyone with a passion is automatically neurodivergent?!
I have observed that often when you ask a 1D person what they think of their 
XYZ friend who is _really_ passionate about a certain hobby they have, then 
the 1D person's response, on average, can be summed up as "Oh, XYZ is great at 
their hobby/craft. ***__They are neurodivergent so that probably helps__***." 
They are supportive and even impressed by their XYZ friend on average which is 
great. However, <wavy>the _infuriating part_ is when they slap the 
"neurodivergent" label on their friend or on any random person greatly 
passionate about something regardless of whether they are really 
neurodivergent or not!</wavy>
<br><br>
"Neurodivergence" is kinda being used like a slur these days. One may say that 
it cannot be classified as a slur because a slur is kinda like an insult; to 
which I wanna say that _I am not trying to get that term classified as a slur_ 
and also, _it does come with an indirect insult_. Suppose there is a person X 
who is passionate about pottery and they are being told that they are good at 
pottery because they are neurodivergent. Now, there are 2 possibilities:
1. They are neurodivergent and in that case, you are basically telling them 
_they are good at pottery because they are neurodivergent_ **while completely 
ignoring the fact that they have put hundreds of hours practicing and honing 
their craft**. Is it insulting that they are neurodivergent here? Nope. Is it 
insulting to them anyhow? If you say no to this, then I don't know what to 
tell you.
2. They are *not* neurodivergent and in that case, the first still applies 
i.e., ignoring their hours of work and practicing and putting it all on "luck" 
BUT ALSO, here you are double insulting them by telling them what they are not!

## <wavy>It is extremely hurtful to ignore someone's hard work</wavy>
Reminds me of a YouTube comment which was under a maths or engineering video. 
The commenter was a guy who was pursuing engineering (or maths) and everybody 
had told him that he must be a genius for making it so far, to the way to a 
prestigious university. <wavy>However, one person told him that he must have 
worked so hard to make it that far and the commenter burst into tears from joy 
as someone finally appreciated the hard work that was put in by the commenter 
to reach where he was and it wasn't just a fluke or being a pRoDiGy</wavy>. (I 
hate that word! I am a big believer of *"Talent without hard work is talent 
wasted"* and *"Hard work can beat talent when talent does not work as hard."*)
<br><br>
From next time, when you meet a hard worker, appreciate their hard work and 
don't just say that "you must be a genius" please. Even if you take nothing 
from this blog post, it's totally fine and understandable but please make this 
a lifelong lesson and pass it on!

## Why passionate people <wavy>_sometimes_</wavy> kinda come off as neurodivergent
Not gonna beat around the bush here. This post is getting too big xD.
<br>
The short answer is that they are kinda bad at communicating. Look, everyone 
by default is bad at communicating and listening. You gotta work on that if 
you want to share your ideas and thoughts with others. I actively work on my 
communication skills every day. That's one of the reasons why this blog exists 
(and also to see how long I can keep blogging without getting cancelled. /s)

## Problems with 1D People
If you think you have a one-dimensional personality, then that's not the end 
of the world! Take tiny steps and you become an interesting person too! Start 
with stopping to doom scrolling (skip this step if it is too hard) and then 
make lots of friends or join clubs (IRL ones if possible, offline >>> online). 
I'll let you see the magic for yourself ;) Oh BTW, document your journey too! 
You will make so many memories which you can share with friends & at parties 
and to not forget them, you should document them and hey, share it with me or 
put them on a blog or something for others to see!

### Struggles of 1D People
Again, without beating around the bush, these are some:
- Not being able to hold long conversations.
- Not many friends or cannot make new friends.
- Failing to get into or hold a relationship.

You really gotta rub off that dry personality. I just mentioned a potential 
solution above in the previous section ^^
<br>
Not to be an ass but I have personally ghosted a lot of people because of 
their dry personality. I, obviously, *indirectly* tell them that they are 
kinda boring to talk to and all of them gets the cue but no one works on it :p
<br>
Remember, <wavy>a conversation is a two way exchange</wavy>. Don't treat the 
other person as if they are your personal entertainer that you have hired or 
something.
<br><br>
Actually, some say that they have their hobbies like _listening music_ but 
c'mon man, is that really a hobby or is it just a way to pass time in 
pleasure without doing any activity? Don't get me wrong, I also enjoy music 
but unless I get into _making_ my own music or something related to that, I 
ain't counting that as a hobby. It has to be something which you can ***share 
with others so that they can enjoy too***. Hobbies can be like cooking which 
you can directly share with others, just by making them a dish or something 
like rock climbing, hiking, camping, safari, etc. which <wavy>*gives you so 
many stories to share*.</wavy>

## Conclusion
Gosh, this post became much more longer than I intended it to. Thanks for 
reading, and I hope I was able to convey my message here! Feels so good to 
get some things off my chest too haha.
