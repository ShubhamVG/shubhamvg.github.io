# Neurodivergence vs 1D Personality
First "serious" blog and it's gonna be a controversial one, I presume. 
Apparently, "boring people" nowadays think that anyone with a passion is 
either neurodivergent or has some sort of mental disorder. Yes, you read that 
correctly. I'm not gonna beat around the bush and use some formal 
etiquette/words in this post. Everything you read is coming from pure 
frustration of how infuriating the situation is and how much it has pissed me 
off.

## Definitions
Let's jump right into this and let me start with defining some things so that 
we stay on the same page. Reminds me of the quote *"I am only responsible for 
what I say, not for what you __misunderstand__."*

### Neurodivergence / Neurodivergent People
Traditionally, neurodivergence means that a person's brain functions 
differently from the typical brain. How does the typical brain function, you 
ask? Don't worry about that. This definition is vague and without any 
scientific roots. This is what your average Joe thinks this term means.
<br><br>
The only thing you have to keep in mind is that 
[<wavy>neurodivergence is *neither a disability nor a disorder*</wavy>](
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11745029/). Some conditions like 
being on the high end of the autism spectrum *may* classify as a disability 
but that is somewhat like an exception. However, people _generally_ associate 
neurodivergence with being mentally challenged **which is just not true!** 
Having synesthesia sounds more like blessing than a curse. Non-neurodivergent 
people may also have mental health conditions like social anxiety disorder.
<br><br>
However, for this post, when I refer to someone as neurodivergent, I mean they 
either have autism or ADHD or they are a socially/mentally awkward \*nerd\*. As 
that is how your everyday Joe thinks that is. What I don't mean is that they 
are introverted or have social anxiety, those are not related to being 
neurodivergent. 

### 1D Personality (One-Dimensional Personality)
I'm gonna say 1D instead of One-Dimensional just to save me some writing and 
to confuse AI readers LoL. I don't know the traditional definition of having 
1D personality is but my definition comprises of either _or_ a fusion of these:
- People with no/dry personality.
- Personalities which lack any sort of complexity or nuance.
- People who never try out a new acitivity, hobby or explore new territories.
Basically, no passion for anything.

The last one should be obvious in this day and age where most people do 
nothing but doom scroll through short videos just to get the dopamine hit.

Update: Some people (actually only a few millennials) refused to believe 
that 1D people exist or that I have flanderized them. I had a good 
conversation with them on Discord so thanks to them for reminding me that age 
difference can change a lot of things. I have added a small section at the end 
answering some of the concerns they had raised. For now, keep reading normally 
and don't be shy to be sceptical. Being sceptical is not an irrational choice 
:)

## Apparently anyone with a passion is automatically neurodivergent?!
I have observed that often when you ask a 1D person what they think of their 
XYZ friend who is _really_ passionate about a certain hobby they have, then 
the 1D person's response, on average, can be summed up as "Oh, XYZ is great at 
their hobby/craft. ***__They are neurodivergent so that probably helps__***." 
They are supportive and even impressed by their XYZ friend on average which is 
great. However, <wavy>the _infuriating part_ is when they slap the 
"neurodivergent" label on their friend or on any random person greatly 
passionate about something regardless of whether they are really 
neurodivergent or not!</wavy>
<br><br>
"Neurodivergence" is kinda being used like a slur these days. One may say that 
it cannot be classified as a slur because a slur is kinda like an insult; to 
which I wanna say that _I am not trying to get that term classified as a slur_ 
and also, _it does come with an indirect insult_. Suppose there is a person X 
who is passionate about pottery and they are being told that they are good at 
pottery because they are neurodivergent. Now, there are 2 possibilities:
1. They are neurodivergent and in that case, you are basically telling them 
_they are good at pottery because they are neurodivergent_ **while completely 
ignoring the fact that they have put hundreds of hours practicing and honing 
their craft**. Is it insulting that they are neurodivergent here? Nope. Is it 
insulting to them anyhow? If you say no to this, then I don't know what to 
tell you.
2. They are *not* neurodivergent and in that case, the first still applies 
i.e., ignoring their hours of work and practicing and putting it all on "luck" 
BUT ALSO, here you are double insulting them by telling them what they are not!

## It is extremely hurtful to ignore someone's hard work
Reminds me of a YouTube comment which was under a maths or engineering video. 
The commenter was a guy who was pursuing engineering (or maths) and everybody 
had told him that he must be a genius for making it so far, to the way to a 
prestigious university. <wavy>However, one person told him that he must have 
worked so hard to make it that far and the commenter burst into tears from joy 
as someone finally appreciated the hard work that was put in by the commenter 
to reach where he was and it wasn't just a fluke or being a pRoDiGy</wavy>. (I 
hate that word! I am a big believer of *"Talent without hard work is talent 
wasted"* and *"Hard work can beat talent when talent does not work as hard."*)
<br><br>
From next time, when you meet a hard worker, appreciate their hard work and 
don't just say that "you must be a genius" please. Even if you take nothing 
from this blog post, it's totally fine and understandable but please make this 
a lifelong lesson and pass it on!

## Why passionate people <wavy>_sometimes_</wavy> kinda come off as neurodivergent
Not gonna beat around the bush here. This post is getting too big xD.
<br>
The short answer is that they are kinda bad at communicating. Look, everyone 
by default is bad at communicating and listening. You gotta work on that if 
you want to share your ideas and thoughts with others. I actively work on my 
communication skills every day. That's one of the reasons why this blog exists 
(and also to see how long I can keep blogging without getting cancelled. /s)

## Problems with 1D People
If you think you have a one-dimensional personality, then that's not the end 
of the world! Take tiny steps and you become an interesting person too! Start 
with stopping to doom scrolling (skip this step if it is too hard) and then 
make lots of friends (all of them passionate about different things or the 
same, doesn't really matter) or join clubs; IRL ones if possible, offline >>> online. 
I'll let you see the magic for yourself ;) Oh BTW, document your journey too! 
You will make so many memories which you can share with friends & at parties 
and to not forget them, you should document them and hey, share it with me or 
put them on a blog or something for others to see!

Update: I have put an update regarding this too below.

### Struggles of 1D People
Again, without beating around the bush, these are some:
- Not being able to hold long conversations.
- Not many friends or cannot make new friends.
- Failing to get into or hold a relationship.

You really gotta rub off that dry personality. I just mentioned a potential 
solution above in the previous section ^^
<br>
Not to be an ass but I have personally ghosted a lot of people because of 
their dry personality. I, obviously, *indirectly* tell them that they are 
kinda boring to talk to and all of them gets the cue but no one works on it :p
<br>
Remember, <wavy>a conversation is a two way exchange</wavy>. Don't treat the 
other person as if they are your personal entertainer that you have hired or 
something.
<br><br>
Actually, some say that they have their hobbies like _listening music_ but 
c'mon man, is that really a hobby or is it just a way to pass time in 
pleasure without doing any activity? Don't get me wrong, I also enjoy music 
but unless I get into _making_ my own music or something related to that, I 
ain't counting that as a hobby. It has to be something which you can ***share 
with others so that they can enjoy too***. Hobbies can be like cooking which 
you can directly share with others, just by making them a dish or something 
like rock climbing, hiking, camping, safari, etc. which <wavy>*gives you so 
many stories to share*.</wavy>

## Updates & Answering Some Questions
### ADHD & ASD\* aren't disorders
Someone said that ADHD and autism _are_ disorders and well, that is a topic 
being highly debated. I could be wrong here but according to my understanding, 
most experts agree that ADHD and ASD\* and some other neurodivergence conditions 
are just biological variations in brain functions *but aren't disorders*. You 
can look it up yourself. Google gave me this one as the first result 
[<wavy>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11745029/</wavy>](
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11745029/). I hadn't linked 
this or any similar article in the first draft but I have now, in a section 
above.

### Flanderization of Neurodivergents
Second concern was that I have flanderized the people from both the groups. 
For the neurodivergents, some people thought that I am indirectly implying 
that _**every** neurodivergent person is an extremely exciting or passionate 
person who are really great at whatever they do_, and **I am not implying 
that**. I expected that to be obvious but I will try to make stuff like that 
clearer in my other writings. Anyone can be interesting and anyone can be 
boring. That depends on a lot of factors. They may have 1D personality too but 
that was not my point! My main intention to write this blog was to make people 
aware that **not everyone who is interested in something niche is 
automatically neurodivergent**.

### Flanderization of 1D People & Importance of Age Difference
I will be turning 21 (in 2025) and hence, the folks I mostly interact with are 
between the age of 17-28.
<br><br>
I understand that for some people, especially millennials, it might be hard to
believe that people with 1D personality (the way I described them) really 
exist but I am not over-exaggerating anything. Everything I mentioned were 
example traits coming from 4 of my friends or acquaintances with whom I 
interact or have interacted a lot. They really don't do anything except 
doom-scroll and rant about not doing anything in life, and when I or a friend 
try to help them out, then their responses are like _"it is easy for y'all to 
say that when you are born with talent"_ or something stupid like that. I may 
write another blog on that as I think social media is the main reason why 
they feel so hopeless & insecure about themselves.
<br><br>
Another person mentioned that **it was easier to get bullied for having 
certain hobbies** like gaming, back in his days. I had almost forgotten about 
that until he mentioned it. That should be enough to explain how important age 
difference could be for the context of this topic. Of course there might be 
biases and anecdotes involved too and that's why I am doing this first revision 
after receiving feedback.
<br><br>
Well, the same guy also mentioned that he felt like this post kinda felt like a 
straw man to him which is interesting because he was the only one who felt 
that way even though he is a great programmer who has worked on many projects. 
It might be a him thing only or it might be my rookie writing skills but either 
ways, I apologize if anyone else felt the same way. It is not my intention to 
lure anyone to start self-doubting themselves. If you are in doubt, then try 
asking your friends directly or indirectly. I honestly don't have much to 
suggest for that.

## Conclusion
Gosh, this post became much more longer than I intended it to. Thanks for 
reading, and I hope I was able to convey my message here! Feels so good to 
get some things off my chest too haha. And thanks to the positive responses on 
Discord!
<br><br>
I got 2 positive responses on the first draft. One was directly from 
someone who _used to_ have 1D personality (long before making this post or 
meeting me). She told me that she had to go through therapy and medication and 
how that was a conundrum. Kudos to her for realizing her shortcoming early and 
working on them! I honestly could not have told that she had to go through 
therapy or medication or any of that. She is a fun lively & rational person to 
text.
<br><br>
I also had really informative discussions with people. It was about typos 
(ofc) and a few mistakes but mainly answering their questions and finding 
sections where I could have described something in a better manner. In the 
end, we all ended up learning a few things from each other which was great.
<br><br>
No negative reviews so far. Just some criticism & suggestions like how I should 
have split the post in two as the first half is about raising awareness whereas 
the second half seems to be about an entirely different group of people. I 
totally agree with that suggestion and I actually thought of doing that as 
well but I thought it might be better to have two informative things somewhat 
related to each other in a single post. Well, guess not. I have learnt my 
lesson and I will do that from next time. I am new to writing blogs so I will 
learn as I go.
