        <h1>Why I will never have a LinkedIn</h1>
        <p>I think the biggest red flag a person can have is being chronically active on
        LinkedIn. I can rant about LinkedIn for hours but fortunately, none of us care
        about LinkedIn. Hence, this post is not really gonna be about that. I mean
        there will be a section for why I don't like LinkedIn but feel free to skip
        that part (you probably should), the <em>hero of the blog</em> is the hilarious story
        of my classmate from high school who has 7 thousand followers on LinkedIn by
        pretending to be a NASA scientist at the age of 17... I KNOW RIGHT! That's
        sOoOoOo stupid but so are the users on LinkedIn who are falling for things
        like this and still using LinkedIn.</p>
        <h2>Problem with LinkedIn</h2>
        <p>The problem with LinkedIn is why it started and how it is going right now. I
        believe it started off for networking and hiring and all that stuff, and I
        presume it worked &amp; that's why LinkedIn became popular. Later on, it kinda
        diverted from being a job market or whatever it used to and sorta became like
        a social media where people can share stuff and that was good too. A lot of
        influential people started posting about real life problems and their
        solutions and a few other things that that did help a lot of people, places
        and businesses bloom. However, this same thing would end up making LinkedIn
        bad.<br><br>
        Remember when I said LinkedIn became sort of like a social media? Yep, people
        instead of using LinkedIn for networking, hiring, sharing real life problems
        started to post things like their lavish life and other unrelated things. It
        got the same problem as Instagram. Everything became about followers and
        chasing clout even if that required people to become pretentious and phony.
        When I last opened LinkedIn, I got barely 1-2 posts related to hiring or
        problem solving or just being passionate about their craft or job, and
        instead, I got like 30 posts of people holding a whiteboard with
        photoshopped text like quotes or random sh*t begging for likes, shares and
        follows or fake tweets with similar text, again begging for likes &amp; follows.
        And I mean, do I need explain anymore? People who are <em><strong>actually
        passionate</strong></em> about their craft are active on their respective platform say
        GitHub for coders and DeviantArt for artists, maybe SoundCloud for musicians
        or whichever is popular these days BUT <em>none of them are being clowns on
        LinkedIn</em> (unless they aren't really actively working on their craft that is.)
        People looking to hire should be looking for active GitHub profile or
        DeviantArt; NOT LinkedIn!<br>
        If any employer is reading this, or anyone who can share this with employers,
        screenshot this section or just send them this blog right away. Ask them to
        read this paragraph specifically.</p>
        <h2>Hero of the post</h2>
        <p>Back to the hilarious story of my friend. Before beginning the story, lemme
        give you some context as to what he was like in school. He was a funny guy.
        You know, the <em>clowns of the class</em> who will do anything and everything to
        make everyone laugh. He was that guy. Never good with studied though. He was
        into photography and cinema so naturally he tried to be a YouTuber. He tried
        product reviews and vlogging but neither worked. Tried streaming too which
        didn't work either. If you still go to his profile on most platforms, you will
        see that he has either written YouTuber or content creator as his profession.
        Anyways, that should be enough for the context. He is a great guy, and good
        cosplayer too actually lol. Coming back to the story tho', so I called him one
        day 'cuz umm let's not reveal why lol. That was after school ended and stuff.
        We weren't in touch for 2 years. Getting his number was hard as well.
        Fortunately, I found his Discord and reminded him about me and got his number.
        We talked for a good while that day. I asked what he was doing and he said
        that he cleared the medical entrance test with a great score. I was shocked
        and but I thought maybe he has actually started to study or something. I was
        congratulating him BUT THEN he pulls off the biggest joke of that day which
        gave everything away. He said that <em>he is working as an astrophysicist for
        NASA</em> xD. I knew that he was kidding so I played along and kept asking him
        questions like &quot;oh cool, in which department?&quot; and &quot;how did you get the offer?&quot;
        and &quot;are you being paid?&quot; and stuff. He answered all of them as if he was
        actually interning for them LoL. I thought maybe he is improv classes as he
        was always interested in cinema. I was very impressed and kept playing along
        as I am also into improv. And oh, his answers were good but you know, I had
        studied physics too so I could clearly see through all the inconsistencies in
        the answers haha. Just then, he mentions his LinkedIn. He said that he posts
        his stuff there. I went to check it after our conversation. I won't be linking
        his profile because of obvious reasons however, I can tell you what I saw.
        First of all, a lot of followers. The numbers back then was 2k and now it is
        7k :p. Secondly, too many epic achievements for a 17 y/o. Like he worked for
        Microsoft as analyst intern, and that at the same time when he was in school.
        B*stard was in the same class with me, sitting right beside me back in those
        days xD. Also, is it even legal to work as a 16 or 17 y/o? I don't think
        Microsoft will risk that. Neither will NASA. He has mentioned that he was
        using his telescope to do astrophotography and sending reports to NASA. Ofc,
        NASA really didn't have better telescopes and cameras with them and oh, also
        they ran out of computing power that they introduced an internship program for
        that and he was the only participant as I could not find the internship on
        NASA's website at all. Anyways, so umm, yeah he has interned for Microsoft,
        NASA, is pursuing 5 degrees at once, everything from astrophysics to MBA, all
        at once. And to back all that up, what did he have? <em><strong>A single PDF he made
        with NASA's logo on it &quot;certifying&quot; him for his amazing blah blah for NASA.</strong></em>
        His profile is just hilarious. I told other friends and cousins about it and
        they were laughing too. One girl also noticed that apparently, he does
        nothing on LinkedIn except post fake certificates on LinkedIn and likes
        weirdass posts from beautiful chicks xD. Also, hate those posts. People on
        LinkedIn really love to show off. They drag their words so much that <em>&quot;I got
        my driving license&quot;</em> becomes <em><strong>&quot;I am honored and thrilled to announce that I
        have been selected among the top 5 applicants who participated in the
        professional... (20 minutes of reading later)... I cannot describe my joy and
        cannot wait to see what chapter will be next in my professional life!&quot;</strong></em></p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Umm, let's keep this one short and use bullet points for that:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>For the employers, decrease relying on LinkedIn profiles and posts. Most of
        them are shit. <strong>Everything I mentioned above was before ChatGPT was a thing.</strong>
        There must be a lot of AI bros on there spreading all sorts of hot garbage.</li>
        <li>For LinkedIn users, really man? At least check the person you are going
        following. I don't suggest people who post motivational stuff or about their
        lavish life. Most of those guys are rich mf spending dad's money and some
        are renting fancy cars and crap just to become popular. Follow those who have passion for a niche or the product/project they are actively work on. Double check for frauds.</li>
        <li>For my friend with the fake account, dude certificates have a link or a QR
        code these days. Add those too otherwise people will know that your PDFs are
        fake XD.</li>
        </ul>
