        <h1>My Journey Broken Down Into Bits</h1>
        <p>Well well well, I really like storytelling but I kinda have a tendency to drag
        a story too long so, I will try my best to keep this one short and not turn it
        into an auto-biography haha. I have divided the story into multiple sections
        which might help digest things. Welp anyways, enjoy the read:</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>So, my name is Shubham but I go by LaV (pronounced as Lav) on the internet. I
        am a 21 y/o (as of 2025) boy passionate about a lot of things, especially those
        related to innovation &amp; problem-solving. I was born in India and currently live
        there. Apart from coding, I have many other hobbies, so many so that I have
        <a href="/hobbies" class="wavy-text">an entire page
        </a> dedicated to it xD.</p>
        <h3>Origin of the name LaV</h3>
        <p>Shubham is hard to pronounce or remember for non-Indians as well as for privacy
        reasons, I had to think of a name for my online presense. My internet name
        used to be V The Otter. V because of Vanadium which is the 23rd (my fav number)
        element on the periodic and also an interesting element on its own. The otter
        part, I don't remember. Probably because I had newly learnt about otters back
        then :p <br>
        I always liked short names but V was kinda too short so I changed it to LaV. A
        fusion of love and lavender, the flower I had seen that day.</p>
        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Since childhood, I was always a curious kid. Mum always tell others a story of
        how I once started to cry because dad fixed a fan without showing me how he did
        it xD. In school, my favorite subjects were science &amp; math. They just made more
        sense than the other subjects, especially when you have a sh*t history
        teacher. I don't have many interesting stories from school except one of how I got a
        school bully group to disbandon but I don't wanna talk about it here. DM me if
        you are interesting in knowing that story.<br></p>
        <h2>First Internship</h2>
        <p>I got an internship during the last year of high school. It was an online one
        during COVID times because home schooling businesses were blooming and they
        needed interns, I presume. That was a fun experience and I got to learn a lot
        from there. I was an operations intern so I was not supposed to use programming
        at all but there were many tasks in the internship that could be automated, and
        that's what I did! I automated many tasks using Python and selenium.
        I knew little bit of coding from school and had learnt Python during lockdown
        to make Discord bots LoL. At this point, I never did programming for a long
        period of time. I liked it but I liked maths or physics more so programming was always an on and off things. Either ways, I am glad that I had that tool in my arsenal because automating tasks made life sOoOoOo much easier :)</p>
        <h2>Learning CS</h2>
        <p>After internship and high school ended, I did not join a uni because of health
        &amp; financial reasons. I decided to try self-learning instead and chose CS as I
        already used it during internship and enjoyed the process. I took CS50 followed
        by nand2tetris and then CS50 Cybersecurity. After that learnt Flutter &amp; many
        other frameworks and tools, and most importantly, <em>escaped tutorial hell</em> and
        started building actual stuff.</p>
        <h2>First Hackathon Win</h2>
        <p>Whilst I was learning, I believe it was January of 2024 and I had just finished
        the nand2tetris course and saw
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-liang-352a95267/" class='wavy-text'>
        <em>Kyle Liang</em></a> in a Discord server asking for permission to promote the
        hackathon him and his team were hosting. Well, they didn't get the permission
        to promote their hackathon but Kyle had his DM open and I wanted to try the
        hackathon experience so I shoot him a DM and he was an awesome guy and same
        for the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ftc_runtimeterror/" 
        class="wavy-text"><em>22105 Runtime Terror</em></a> team! It was my first hackathon
        so I was confused on a lot of things but they helped me with everything. The
        hackathon was online weekend event so it lasted 2 days. I, fortunately or
        unfortunately, could not assemble a team so I had to participate alone. I
        still named my &quot;team&quot; <em>[object Object]</em> haha. The theme of that year's <strong>22105
        Runtime Terror</strong> Hackathon was <strong>art</strong>. (So thankful to them that I gotta say
        their name multiple time xD.)<br>
        I created <a href="https://devpost.com/software/static-art-into-dynamic-life" class="wavy-text">Static Art Into
        Dynamic Life</a> inspired by the <a href="https://youtu.be/3G1KBu6H6BM" 
        class="wavy-text">Chinese Drones Dragon</a> they have flying in their new year.
        I had to skip a wedding dinner party (of a distant relative) for it actually
        xD and had to record the video at 1 AM or something late at night. It was
        totally worth it! And it was so cool that I won too!! Yep, that's right. I won
        my first hackathon ;)</p>
        <h2>Not sure what to name this section</h2>
        <p>After the hackathon ended, I got $50 for participating. I decided to spend it
        on getting back in shape yk, shredding all that lockdown fat xD. I went from
        69 to 62 (kg ofc) in under 3 months thanks to <a 
        href="https://youtu.be/66G_M9TkFCU" class="wavy-text">this great video
        on the science behind dieting</a>. I suggest everyone that video if they wanna
        get into shape. Well anyways, I took CS50 Cybersecurity and started learning
        Flutter and stuff around this time. I tried to participate in a second
        hackathon, online ofc, but I, AGAIN, failed to assemble a team and tried doing
        everyone on my own. I had around half a month for this hackathon actually so I
        thought that I could pull it off but nope. I ended up getting burnt out and had
        to pull back off from the hackathon. That hackathon was either by Google or the
        Flutter team where you had to make a game promoting sustainable development
        using Flutter, and I had a great idea for the game too! Good enough to secure
        me a spot on the podium is what I'd like to believe. Anyways, not sure what the
        status is now but making games in Flutter (or Flame, a game engine made for
        Flutter) sucked back then, especially since I was so new to Flutter back then.
        My previous experience with making games was with the Godot game engine and it
        has this node-based editor which was very different to what I had to use with
        Flame.</p>
        <h2>Current Stuff</h2>
        <p>Well, in the last section I told you about one of my &quot;failures&quot; or how folks
        say it these days, <em>I took an L</em> so, let's start this section with a W so,
        I won a hackathon in November/December 2024. This time it was in a team. The
        team was assembled by <em>Lingaraj Patil</em>, a Discord guy and we had <em>Tejaswini
        Gaikwad</em> as well. We shared ideas on a call, selected Lingaraj's idea as it was
        the best among all the pitched ideas. His original idea was slightly different
        tho'. I, being the most experienced one in the team, decided to take the lead
        of the project and made slight changes. Teju became the UI developer and
        Lingaraj was dealing with finding the name of the app/project and the logo &amp;
        stuff. He also came up with a skit that inspired the presentation we did. My
        duties were to program the app and guide everything to be on track. I was also
        the video editor and the presentation maker inspired by Lingaraj's idea. We
        made a catchy presentation and it worked too haha. We won the <em>GNEC '24 Fall
        Hackathon</em> with our submission <a href="https://devpost.com/software/recyclopia" class="wavy-text">
        Recyclopia</a>.</p>
        <p>After that, I finished many projects which you can check in the
        <a href="/projects" class="badge">Projects Page</a> and
        made some YouTube videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bottleofotter" class="badge">@bottleofotter
        </a> and umm yeahhh, that is about it. Still working on fancy projects, though
        I run out of ideas pretty quickly :p. Also, help with docs on open-sourced
        projects or whatever I use and find on GitHub. Well, I am thinking about doing
        GSoC this year (2025) or apply for a job. If you are looking to hire me, then
        you can find my email which is in the footer of this page or go to the
        <a href="/contacts" class="badge">Contacts</a> page.</p>
        <h2>That's it for now</h2>
        <p>I guess that is it for now. I will update this page when something interesting
        happens. I should be updating the other pages too so keep a look at those too
        if interested. Thanks for reading. May you have a great day or night!</p>
